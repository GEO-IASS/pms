Photometric Stereo
==================

This repository is a first try at Photometric Stereo. It mainly targets researchers needing an implementation of the early papers in photometric stereo, mainly [1] and [2]. Note that **these formulations are now considered obsolete**, you should look at newer papers for an up-to-date and efficient formulation.
