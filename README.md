Photometric Stereo
==================

This software aims to build a 3D reconstruction from light informations in image. It is primarily based on the works of Woodham [1] with enhancements to come.

Installation
------------

Requirements:

* Python >= 3.2 or >= 2.7
** Numpy
* POV-Ray (for the tests)

POV-Ray
~~~~~~~

Ensure you have a valid POV-Ray installation with the executable `povray` available on your PATH. On Windows, the simplest way to achieve this is to download [megapov](http://megapov.inetart.net/), create a shortcut named `povray` to `megapov` and put it in your PATH environment variable.
